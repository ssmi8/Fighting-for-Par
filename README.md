## UX

## The Strategy Plane

* Fighting for Par is intended to be inviting as well as informative for users so they can feel encouraged to joing the golf society.  Looking at other similar golf society websites, this is the case, so it was important to reflect this in my webiste. The overall design and video/images provide the user with a visual indicator of what the site is about and to set the tone of their experience on the site.

### Site Goals

* To provide users with a sense of community and encouargement to join the society.
* To ensure the site if fully accessible on desktop and mobile/handheld devices.

## User Stories

* As a user I want a site that is easy to read
* As a user I want a site that is clear, informative and well structured
* As a user I want a site that has clear navigation
* As a user I want a site that I can use on all devices without an impact on experience

## The Scope Plane

### Features planned:

* Responsive Design - The site should function correctly across the range of devices the user could potentially use to access the site on such as Desktop, Laptop, Tablet and Mobile devices.
* All navigation elements should be contained within the main screen. No need to search for anything.
* The site should be visually stimulating and clear to the user that it is a website for a golf society.
* The site should be informative and well structured.
* The site should allow the user the ability to sign up to the golf society.

## The Strucure Plane

In order to implement what, as a user, I would come to expect from similar website I have ensured the following:

* The layout, colours chosen, font choice and images/video choices will all convey a community and fun experience and to ensure the user understand the purpose of the site.
* The user will be able to clearly navigate through each of the pages and in doing so journey through the landing page, which is informative, the gallery page, which shows the user the experiences to be had, and then finally to the sign up page where they can join the society.


## The Skeleton Plane

### Design

The structure of the website is based on the following golf club, which I found during my research into other golf club/society websites:

- [London Golf Club](https://londongolf.co.uk/)

By using this website as inspiration, I knew I could create a professional looking website, as well as creating a non-elite atmosphere which would encourage a wider group of people.

Other sites I researched are below:

- [The Social Golfer](https://www.thesocialgolfer.com/FindGroup.aspx)
- [Golf Societies UK and Ireland](https://www.golfsocieties.uk.net/)
- [The Golf Society of Britain](https://golfsocietygb.com/)

I found that most golf based websites relied heavily on imagery, with not a lot of content.  Therefore I chose to mix the two, so that new users could easily understand what the wesbite was for and was easily understandable.

### Wireframe mockups

I initially used Figma to produce wireframes of how I wanted to the website to look.  Using Figma enabled me to consider multiple layouts for the site before settling on a final design.

### Home Page

### Gallery Page

### Sign Up Page


## The Surface Plane


Once I was happy with my overall structure and layout of content for the website, I could start to think about the colour scheme and font selection, to ensure the website is easy to read and to clearly navigate and understand.

For the home page I wanted a clear header with navigation links, and also wanted a looping video to engage the user and allow the user to immediately know what the website was about.
