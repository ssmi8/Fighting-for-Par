## About Fighting for Par

* Fighting for Par is a website aiming to encourage more participation in golf by creating a society/community which creates a welcoming atmosphere.
* Fighting for Par is a golf society allowing players of all abilities, genders and ages to participate in golf, across various golf courses.
* Users can sign up to the golf society so they can become a part of the golf community and play more golf.
* As the website promotes a community spirit and friendships, users will be encouraged to join.
* Future development of the website will allow members to communicate on a forum as well as book tee times at various courses.

## The Purpose

* The purpose of this website to is to create a society where you are not limited to playing at one golf course, and you can become part of a diverse community where you can also meet different people.  Building a community around the sport that is golf, enables a wider range of people to become a part of it, even if they are from different backgrounds.  The aim is to enjoy golf, aswell as participate.  It encourages people of all abilities to join and improve their golf, or even if they just play to have fun.

## UX

## The Strategy Plane

* Fighting for Par is intended to be inviting as well as informative for users so they can feel encouraged to join the golf society.  Looking at other similar golf society websites, this is the case, so it was important to reflect this in my website. The overall design and video/images provide the user with a visual indicator of what the site is about and to set the tone of their experience on the site.

### Site Goals

* To provide users with a practical and informative site.
* To ensure that navigating through the site is easy, intuitive and flowing.  Users don't need to work out where to go.
* To provide users with a sense of community and encouragement to join the society.
* To ensure the site if fully accessible on desktop and mobile/handheld devices.

### User Stories

* As a user I want a site that is easy to read
* As a user I want a site that is clear, informative, and well structured
* As a user I want a site that has clear navigation
* As a user I want a site that I can use on all devices without an impact on experience

## The Scope Plane

### Features planned:

* Responsive Design - The site should function correctly across the range of devices the user could potentially use to access the site on such as Desktop, Laptop, Tablet and Mobile devices.
* All navigation elements should be contained within the main screen. No need to search for anything.
* The site should be visually stimulating and clear to the user that it is a website for a golf society.
* The site should be informative and well structured.
* The site should allow the user the ability to sign up to the golf society.

## The Structure Plane

In order to implement what, as a user, I would come to expect from similar websites, I have ensured the following:

* The layout, colours, fonts and images/video choices all convey a positive experience for the user and to ensure the user understands the purpose of the site.
* The user will be able to clearly navigate through each of the pages and in doing so journey through the landing page, which is informative, the gallery page, which shows the user the experiences to be had, and then finally to the sign up page where they can join the society.
* The website is not only clear and concise but also accessible to all users.

## The Skeleton Plane

### Design

The structure of the website is based on the following golf club, which I found during my research into other golf club/society websites:

- [London Golf Club](https://londongolf.co.uk/)

By using this website as inspiration, I knew I could create a professional looking website, as well as creating a non-elite atmosphere which would encourage a wider group of people to join the society from the landing page.

Other sites I researched are below:

- [The Social Golfer](https://www.thesocialgolfer.com/FindGroup.aspx)
- [Golf Societies UK and Ireland](https://www.golfsocieties.uk.net/)
- [The Golf Society of Britain](https://golfsocietygb.com/)

I found that most golf based websites relied heavily on imagery, with not a lot of content.  Therefore I chose to mix the two, so that new users could easily understand what the website was for and was easily understandable.

### Wireframe Mockups

I initially used Figma to produce wireframes of how I wanted to the website to look.  This enabled me to consider multiple layouts for the site before settling on a final design.  Whilst implementing my design, I added a few features that are not in my wireframe designs, as I felt I wanted to add a more professional feel to the site and also add a bit more depth, which I felt the website needed.

## The Surface Plane


Once I was happy with my overall structure and layout of content for the website, I could start to think about the colour scheme and font selection.  This is to ensure the website is easy to read and clearly navigate.

For the home page I wanted a clear header with navigation links.  I also wanted a looping video to engage the user and allow the user to immediately know what the website was about.  

## Features

The site covers three pages.  The home page (landing page) is the main page which covers the content and information about the website and its purpose.  The second page (the gallery) shows images of what joining the society could entail.  Finally, the last page (sign up form) allows the user to join the golf society. 
Future development of the Fighting for Par will lead to a much more expansive website covering forums, bookings, and more interaction between members.

### Header & Navigation Bar

* The header contains the logo "Fighting for Par" on the left side and the navigation links to the "Home" "Gallery and "Sign Up" pages.
* A line sits under the page the user is currently on, and if you hover over a link, a white line appears under the link.
* Using flex design the navigation links move to the left, under the logo on smaller screens.

### Video

* The looping video of a golf course is used as a hero image and was selected to look similar to the websites I found during my research, which gives the user an immediate understanding of what the website is about.
* This video is on a continuous loop and has no sound.

### The Three Key Benefits

* This section highlights the three key benefits that the society focuses on which is, Great Venues, Competitions and Social.
* I wanted this section near the top so the user can clearly see the benefits of joining the society.  Many users want to know the venues will be of a high calibre, there is an option to compete with fellow members and it is a social sport, where you can meet new people.

<img src="/assets/ux-files/three-benefits-screenshot.png" width="auto" height="auto">

### Why us?

* This section pushes on from the three key benefits.
* In concise paragraphs, the user can easily read the text and understand why they should join the golf society.
* I have used images here to help convey the message and this should create interest and allow the user to make informed decisions.

<img src="/assets/ux-files/why-this-screenshot-2.png" width="auto" height="auto">
<img src="/assets/ux-files/why-this-screenshot-3.png" width="auto" height="auto">

### Gallery Page

* This section is an image gallery which shows the user existing members during their time with the golf society.
* The purpose of this section is to give confidence to the user that the golf society provides the message conveyed in the home page.
* This section uses CSS grid to be easily responsive.

### Sign Up Page

* The sign up section allows the user to sign up to fighting for par.
* The sign up section also allows the user to enter a competition, where they have a chance to win a free round of golf.
* This section uses a full image background, with the form in the foreground.
* The user can easily enter their details, along with some questions to get a better understanding of the user.
* Once the user complets the form to sign up they are taken to the Code Institue form dump site.

### Footer

* Footer section is where the social media links are displayed.
* The user is encouraged to find out more information using these links.
* Along with the header, the footer is conistent on each page the user clicks.
* The social media links open in new tab upon clicking on them.

## Testing

Testing was done as each change was saved.

* Within Gitpod I utilized the live server extension to see changes in real time.
* Using google developer tools I checked the responsiveness when changing screen sizing and used the desktop and mobile filters
* Upon pushing the code to github I ran the lighthouse reports for mobile and desktop.
* Lastly I ran the code through validators to look for errors in html and css.

## Errors

* Upon using media queries I realised that my footer would move from the bottom of the screen to the middle when content broke through the bottom of the page.  As I learned more about position and media queries, I was able to recitfy this.
* When creating the gallery, I found my images were not in line at the bottom of the page and sizing was inconsistent.  I therefore used CSS grid to better shape the images and make a much cleaner view.
* When running through my progress with my mentor, I found that my form was not responsive to screen sizing.  Thanks to my mentor Rahul for helping resolve this by using flex box.
* Upon reviwing the html code I found an error in the video file name which contained spaces. I then rectified this by amending the file name to include zero spaces.
