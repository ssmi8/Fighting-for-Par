## UX

## The Strategy Plane

* Fighting for Par is intended to be inviting as well as informative for users so they can feel encouraged to joing the golf society.  Looking at other similar golf society websites, this is the case, so it was important to reflect this in my webiste. The overall design and video/images provide the user with a visual indicator of what the site is about and to set the tone of their experience on the site.

### Site Goals

* To provide users with a pratical and informative site.
* To ensure that navigating through the site is easy, intuitive and flowing.  Users don't need to work out where to go.
* To provide users with a sense of community and encouargement to join the society.
* To ensure the site if fully accessible on desktop and mobile/handheld devices.

## User Stories

* As a user I want a site that is easy to read
* As a user I want a site that is clear, informative and well structured
* As a user I want a site that has clear navigation
* As a user I want a site that I can use on all devices without an impact on experience

## The Scope Plane

### Features planned:

* Responsive Design - The site should function correctly across the range of devices the user could potentially use to access the site on such as Desktop, Laptop, Tablet and Mobile devices.
* All navigation elements should be contained within the main screen. No need to search for anything.
* The site should be visually stimulating and clear to the user that it is a website for a golf society.
* The site should be informative and well structured.
* The site should allow the user the ability to sign up to the golf society.

## The Strucure Plane

In order to implement what, as a user, I would come to expect from similar website I have ensured the following:

* The layout, colours chosen, font choice and images/video choices will all convey a community and fun experience and to ensure the user understand the purpose of the site.
* The user will be able to clearly navigate through each of the pages and in doing so journey through the landing page, which is informative, the gallery page, which shows the user the experiences to be had, and then finally to the sign up page where they can join the society.


## The Skeleton Plane

### Design

The structure of the website is based on the following golf club, which I found during my research into other golf club/society websites:

- [London Golf Club](https://londongolf.co.uk/)

By using this website as inspiration, I knew I could create a professional looking website, as well as creating a non-elite atmosphere which would encourage a wider group of people.

Other sites I researched are below:

- [The Social Golfer](https://www.thesocialgolfer.com/FindGroup.aspx)
- [Golf Societies UK and Ireland](https://www.golfsocieties.uk.net/)
- [The Golf Society of Britain](https://golfsocietygb.com/)

I found that most golf based websites relied heavily on imagery, with not a lot of content.  Therefore I chose to mix the two, so that new users could easily understand what the wesbite was for and was easily understandable.

### Wireframe mockups

I initially used Figma to produce wireframes of how I wanted to the website to look.  Using Figma enabled me to consider multiple layouts for the site before settling on a final design.

### Home Page


### Gallery Page

### Sign Up Page


## The Surface Plane


Once I was happy with my overall structure and layout of content for the website, I could start to think about the colour scheme and font selection, to ensure the website is easy to read and to clearly navigate and understand.

For the home page I wanted a clear header with navigation links, and also wanted a looping video to engage the user and allow the user to immediately know what the website was about.  

## Features

The site is a single landing page with several sections. Future development of the Billme idea will lead to a much more expansive website covering company, product, services, resources, support, pricing as well as the backend of the platform that users sign in to.

### Header & Navigation Bar

* The header contains the logo "Fighting for Part" on the left side and the navigation links to the "Home" "Gallery and "Sign Up" pages.
* A line sits under the page the user is currently on, and if you hover over a link, a white line appears under the link.
* Using flex desgin the navigation links move to the left, under the logo on smaller screens.

### Video

* The looping video of a golf course is used as a hero image and was selected to look similar to the websites I found during my research, which gives the user an immediate understanding of what the website is about.
* This video is on a continuous link and has no sound.

### The Three Key Benefits

* This section highlights the three key benefits that the society focuses on which is, Great Venues, Competitions and Social.
* I wanted this section near the top so the user can clearly see the benefits of joining the society.  Many users want to know the venues will be of a high calibre, there is an option to compete with fellow memebers and it is a social sport, where you can meet new people.

### Why us?

* This section pushes on from the three key benefits.
* In concise paragraphs, the user can easily read the text and understand why they should join the golf society.
* I have used images here to help convey the message and this should create interest and allow the user to make informed decisions.

### Gallery Page

* This section is an image gallery which shows the user existing memebers during their time with the golf society.
* The purpose of this section is to give confidence to the user that the golf socity provides the message conveyed in the home page.
* This section uses CSS grid to be easily responsive.

### Sign Up Page

* The sign up section allows the user to sign up to fighting for par.
* The sign up section also allows the user to enter a competition, where they have a chance to win a free round of golf.
* This section uses a full image background, with the form in the foreground.
* The user can easily enter their details, along with some questions to get a better understanding of the user.

### Footer

* Footer section is where the social media links are displayed.
* The user is encouraged to find out more information using these links.
* Along with the header, the footer is conistent on each page the user clicks.
* The social media links open in new tab upon clicking on them.

## Testing

Testing was done as each change was saved.

* Within Gitpod I utilized the live server extension to see changes in real time.
* Using google developer tools I checked the responsiveness when changing screen sizing and used the desktop and mobile filters
* Upon pushing the code to github I ran the lighthouse reports for mobile and desktop.
* Lastly I ran the code through validators to look for errors in html and css.

## Errors

* Upon using media queries I realised that my footer would move from the bottom of the screen to the middle when content broke through the bottom of the page.  As I learned more about position and media queries, I was able to recitfy this.
* When creating the gallery, I found my images were not in line at the bottom of the page and sizing was inconsistent.  I therefore used CSS grid to better shape the images and make a much cleaner view.
* When running through my progress with my mentor, I found that my form was not responsive to screen sizing.  Thanks to my mentor Rahul for helping resolve this by using flex box.
