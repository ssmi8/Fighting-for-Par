            <p>Joining the golf society you will join a great community of people to share golfing tips, play great rounds of golf and build lasting friendships. Golf is sociable and it is one of the best for meeting new people and maintaining established relationships. Walking the golf course is an ideal method of catching up with friends and family.</p>

            <h2>Healthy Competition</h2>
            <hr>
            <P>If you’re a member of a club, then you’ll get to experience competitions. If you belong to the nomadic title, however, then you won’t. While the society does provide healthy competition, it’s a lot more fun. Winning isn’t the overall goal, playing well and enjoying your afternoon is where the importance lies.</P>

            <h2>Different Golf Courses</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>While I’m sure we are all proud of the golf club that we belong to, sometimes, just sometimes, it’s refreshing not to play the same course consecutively. Course knowledge and game management are two useful skills, but when you play a new course, the former goes out the window – 18 holes of pure chaos.</p>

            <hr>
            <P>If you’re an avid golfer, then we know you want to play more golf. There is not a single golfer on this planet that feels they play too much golf – Is it even possible to play too much golf?!  Either way, if you're an avid lover of golf or even just starting out, then this golf society is for you!</P>
